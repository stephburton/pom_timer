# Python Pomodoro Timer - Project Notes

## Why am I building this thing...

I'm building this very small app to learn how to write Python code. Why a pomodoro timer? Because I'm trying to learn a lot of things right now and I have ADHD. I've found the pomodoro method to be very helpful when I'm trying to learn a lot of dense stuff. Especially if I want to learn quickly.

## What have I done so far...
